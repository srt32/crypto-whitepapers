# Crypto Whitepapers

This repo is meant to serve as a repository of whitepapers.

They are sourced from projects' website and crawled automatically by the code
in
[https://github.com/srt32/whitepaper-rank](https://github.com/srt32/whitepaper-rank),
which uses website data from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com).

The dataset is currently limited as the crawling code needs to be made more
robust and flexible.

PR's welcome!
